# ThreatIntelligence

TODO: Delete this and the text below, and describe your gem

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/threat_Intelligence`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

## Installation

TODO: Replace `UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG` with your gem name right after releasing it to RubyGems.org. Please do not do it earlier due to security reasons. Alternatively, replace this section with instructions to install your gem from git if you don't plan to release to RubyGems.org.

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

```bash
bundle add UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG
```

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

```bash
gem install UPDATE_WITH_YOUR_GEM_NAME_IMMEDIATELY_AFTER_RELEASE_TO_RUBYGEMS_ORG
```

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

Production-Ready Threat Intelligence Application
I've created a comprehensive, production-ready Ruby application for Domain/IP Reputation, URL Classification & Threat Intelligence. Here are the key features:

Core Components
Multi-Provider Integration

VirusTotal API for domain, IP, and URL analysis
AbuseIPDB for IP abuse detection
Extensible architecture for adding more providers (Shodan, URLScan.io, etc.)
Domain Reputation Checker

DNS information retrieval
Aggregated reputation scoring
Risk level classification (low, medium, high, critical)
Domain validation and sanitization
IP Reputation Checker

Public/private IP detection
Multi-source reputation aggregation
Geolocation information
Tor node detection
Abuse confidence scoring
URL Classification System

Pattern-based malicious URL detection
Risk scoring algorithm
Indicator detection (IP addresses, suspicious TLDs, URL shorteners, etc.)
Protocol and path analysis
Production Features

Redis Caching: TTL-based caching to reduce API calls and improve performance
Rate Limiting: Configurable request throttling per minute
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling with custom exceptions
Logging: Structured logging with configurable log levels
Thread-Safe: Concurrent bulk analysis with thread pool
Configuration Management: Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
Timeout Protection: Configurable timeouts for API requests
Advanced Capabilities
Bulk Analysis: Analyze multiple targets concurrently with configurable thread pool
Automatic Target Detection: Intelligently detects whether input is IP, domain, or URL
Report Generation: JSON-formatted reports with summaries and recommendations
CLI Interface: Full command-line interface for easy integration
Security Best Practices
Frozen string literals for performance
Input validation and sanitization
Private/internal IP detection
Rate limiting to prevent abuse
Secure API key management via environment variables
Usage Examples
# Configuration
ThreatIntelligence.configure do |config|
config.virustotal_api_key = 'your-api-key'
config.abuseipdb_api_key = 'your-api-key'
config.cache_ttl = 3600
config.rate_limit_per_minute = 60
end

# Single analysis
service = ThreatIntelligence::Service.new
result = service.analyze('example.com')
puts result

# Bulk analysis
targets = ['google.com', '8.8.8.8', 'https://malicious-site.com']
results = service.bulk_analyze(targets, max_concurrency: 5)

# Generate report
report_generator = ThreatIntelligence::ReportGenerator.new
report = report_generator.generate(result)
puts report
Copy
CLI Usage
# Check single target
ruby threat_intelligence.rb check google.com

# Bulk check
ruby threat_intelligence.rb bulk google.com 8.8.8.8 example.com

# View configuration
ruby threat_intelligence.rb config
Copy
Required Dependencies
Add to your Gemfile:

gem 'redis', '~> 5.0'
gem 'concurrent-ruby', '~> 1.2'
Copy
Environment Setup
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY='your-key'
export ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY='your-key'
export REDIS_URL='redis://localhost:6379/0'
Copy
Extensibility
The application is designed with extensibility in mind:

Add new API providers by extending BaseAPIClient
Customize classification patterns in URLClassifier
Extend report formats in ReportGenerator
Add custom risk scoring algorithms
This is a production-ready solution with proper error handling, caching, rate limiting,
